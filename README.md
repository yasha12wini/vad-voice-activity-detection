This MATLAB project deploys a Voice Activity Detection (VAD) system on the basis of Short-Time Energy (STE) and Zero-Crossing Rate (ZCR). Voice Activity Detection is a basic process utilized in speech processing systems to separate speech segments from silences in an audio signal. This project starts by loading an audio file (audio_f1.wav), and if it is stereo, it is converted to mono format followed by waveform visualization.
The audio signal is segmented into 20 millisecond overlapping frames with a 10 millisecond shift. Two features are calculated for each frame: short-time energy (picking up the loudness) and zero-crossing rate (picking up the frequency content). The features are normalized and matched against pre-defined thresholds to classify each frame as containing speech (1) or silence (0).
The script plots a few of them to display the process: the original audio waveform, the energy and ZCR with their thresholds, and a third one displaying the VAD decisions over time with a stem plot. This implementation is useful in understanding simple feature extraction and thresholding-based classification of speech signals.
To execute this project, just need MATLAB and a .wav audio file in the same folder. The frame duration, frame shift, energy threshold, and ZCR threshold parameters can be adjusted according to different audio conditions. This project is an application of speech segmentation and digital signal processing.
